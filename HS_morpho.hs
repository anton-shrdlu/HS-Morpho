{-
Each stem (V,N,A,D...) has an associated set of features.
Items are taken from the Lexicon with their (fully specified) set of features.
No features are added.

Syntax gets the inflected word without structure but with all its features.
-}

{- Subject Principle
Compatability: (Ident)
The features of the exponent are a subset of the features of the stem
Specificity: (Max)
The Exponent is the most specic item that satisfies compatability

{-
Constraints could be DFSTs that target one of the three lists in the Workspace.
Except many seem to compare between features on Morphemes and features on the stem (this could mean faithfulness)
mc only checks the number of arrays (this could be markedness, unless we change it to check between IO)
