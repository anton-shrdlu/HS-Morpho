# HS-Morpho

Inflectional morphology with Harmonic Serialism in Haskell.\
Based one [Müller (2020)](https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/inflectional-morphology/).
For now straight implementation; goals to use FSTs instead in the future.\
The Fst.hs module was written by [@toluene](https://github.com/toluene).
