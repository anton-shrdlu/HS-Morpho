{-
Each stem (V,N,A,D...) has an associated set of features.
Tems are taken from the Lexicon with their (fully specified) set of features.
No features are added.

Syntax gets the inflected word without structure but with all its features.

{- Subject Principle
Compatability: (Ident)
The features of the exponent are a subset of the features of the stem
Specificity: (Max)
The Exponent is the most specic item that satisfies compatability
